    <h3>Vada pav, alternatively spelt <em>wada pao</em>, ( listen) is a vegetarian fast food dish native to the Indian state of Maharashtra. The dish consists of a deep fried potato dumpling placed inside a bread bun (pav) sliced almost in half through the middle.</h3>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Pav</li>
        <li>Batata vada</li>
        <li>Green Chutney</li>
        <li>Tamarind Chutney</li>
        <li>Garlic Chutney</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Boil 2 large potatoes that weigh about 350 grams. Peel and then mash them with a fork in a bowl.</li>
        <li>Heat 2 to 3 teaspoons of oil in a small pan. Add ½ a teaspoon of mustard seeds and crackle them. Then add 7 to 8 curry leaves and a pinch of asafoetida (hing). Stir and sauté for about 5 seconds on low heat.</li>
        <li>Add the crushed garlic cloves and green chilies mixture to the pan. Add ⅛ teaspoon of turmeric powder (about 2 to 3 pinches).</li>
        <li>Stir on a low heat for some seconds or until the raw aroma of garlic goes away.</li>
        <li>Pour this tempering mixture together with the oil to the mashed potatoes.</li>
        <li>Add 1 to 2 tablespoons of chopped coriander leaves (cilantro) and salt as required.</li>
        <li>Mix everything well with a spoon. Do a taste test and if needed, add more salt. Then make small to medium balls from the mashed potato mixture. Flatten these balls a bit. Cover and keep aside.</li>
        <li>In another bowl, make a smooth batter from 1 to 1.25 cups besan (gram flour), ⅛ teaspoon turmeric powder (about 2 to 3 pinches), a pinch of asafoetida (hing), a pinch of baking soda (optional), salt and ½ cup water or as needed.</li>
        <li>Dip the slightly flattened potato balls in the batter and coat it evenly with the batter.</li>
        <li>Before you dip the batata vada in the batter, heat oil in a pan or wok (kadai). When the oil becomes hot then dip the batata vada in the batter to coat as shown in the above steps.</li>
        <li>Serve them when they are still hot or warm. Put all the chutneys and pav on your work surface. Slice the pav without breaking it into two parts and set aside.</li>
        <li>Spread both the green chutney and sweet chutney on the sliced pav. You can also spread green chutney on one side and sweet chutney on the other side.</li>
        <li> Sprinkle the dry garlic chutney on the pav. This step is optional and you can skip it if you don’t have garlic chutney.</li>
        <li>Place the hot batata vada in the bread slices.</li>
        <li>Serve vada pav immediately or else the pav becomes soggy. You can also serve some salted fried green chilies and both of the chutneys with it.</li>
    </ol>
